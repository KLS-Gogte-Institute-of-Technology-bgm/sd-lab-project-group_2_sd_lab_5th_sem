+ Super market management is not so easy by usual means of manual traditional techniques. 
+ So to make this process easy a software with many functionalities can be developed. functionalaities like adding, deleting, updating product details,updating the database, 
maintaining the customer details would make this task easy.
+ The software will first ask the login credentials then it will list up various options like view products in warehouse, add new products, add customer details, 
view existing customers. A sell item field would allow to select the item and once the item is sold the count decreases.
